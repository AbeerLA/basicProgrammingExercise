# â˜• Cafe Drink Menu

## ðŸ“Œ About This Project

This project is inspired by my love for cafes and the different types of drinks they serve. I wanted to create a digital drink menu that separates coffee and non-coffee items, displays images of each, and shows different sizes and prices â€” all structured with Object-Oriented Programming in Python, and displayed using a clean HTML/CSS layout.

## ðŸ§± Features

- ðŸ”¹ Grouped drink menu (Coffee & Non-Coffee)
- ðŸ”¹ Each drink shows available sizes and prices
- ðŸ”¹ Images for each drink
- ðŸ”¹ OOP design using Python (with inheritance and polymorphism)
- ðŸ”¹ HTML/CSS layout with 2-column visual menu

## ðŸ§  OOP Structure

- `Drink` â€“ Abstract base class
- `CoffeeDrink` â€“ Inherits from `Drink`
- `NonCoffeeDrink` â€“ Inherits from `Drink`
- `drinks.json` â€“ Stores all drinks with type, sizes, and image path
